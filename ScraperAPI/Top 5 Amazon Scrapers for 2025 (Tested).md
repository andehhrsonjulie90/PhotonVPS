## What Is an Amazon Scraping API?

Amazon scraping APIs serve as remote tools that allow you to collect structured data from Amazon effortlessly. You send a request with your target URL and parameters (like geolocation), and the API handles the heavy lifting. These APIs often include:

- **IP rotation and CAPTCHA solving** to avoid being blocked.
- **Data parsers** to extract only relevant information (e.g., product titles, prices, reviews).
- **Global targeting** for localized data collection.

While building your own scraper is an option, ready-to-use APIs save you time and resources.

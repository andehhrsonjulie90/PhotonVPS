## What Is Property Data Collection?

Property data collection is a standardized process where trained data collectors gather essential information about a property and document it with photographs. This data is then compiled into a **property data report** that is shared with mortgage lenders or real estate appraisers to facilitate **desktop or hybrid appraisals**.

### The Evolution of Property Data Collection

Before 2019, mortgage lenders typically required a comprehensive appraisal for loan approvals. However, this approach often caused delays in the loan origination process. In response, **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac** introduced new options to streamline the process:
1. **Desktop appraisals**
2. **Hybrid desktop appraisals**
3. **Property data reports**

These options rely on accurate property data collection, creating a growing demand for skilled property data collectors.

## Responsibilities of a Property Data Collector

A property data collector conducts on-site inspections and documents the following key details:

- **Building materials**: Exterior cladding, flooring, roofing, etc.
- **Foundation type**: Slab, crawl space, or basement.
- **Floor plan specifics**: Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and measurements.
- **Additional structures**: Outbuildings, garages, or sheds.
- **Utilities**: Municipal water and sewage versus well and septic systems.
- **Safety and structural issues**: Any observable defects or hazards.

Data collectors also take photographs and use tools to create detailed floor plans. The collected information is compiled into a report and submitted to the appraisal management company (AMC) or mortgage lender.

## Are Property Data Reports the Same as Appraisals?

No, they are not. While **property data collection** is a fact-based process, appraisals involve more comprehensive evaluations conducted by licensed or certified appraisers. 

### Key Differences:
- **Property Data Reports**: Include only observable facts with no analysis or judgment.
- **Appraisals**: Provide detailed market value assessments based on analysis, comparisons, and professional expertise.

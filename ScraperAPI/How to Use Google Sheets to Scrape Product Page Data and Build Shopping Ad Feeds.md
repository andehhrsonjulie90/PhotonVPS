# How to Use Google Sheets to Scrape Product Page Data and Build Shopping Ad Feeds

## Introduction

Have you ever needed to extract data from websites? For example, when creating a new shopping ad campaign, you might lack a product feed to quickly build the ads. Ideally, we'd have the required content like landing pages and product names available in an easy-to-import format like Excel or Google Sheets. However, many advertisers unfamiliar with data scraping often end up copying and pasting hundreds or thousands of product details manually.

Recently, I was tasked with downloading data for around 150 products from 15 client website pages. Manually copying each product's name and landing page URL into a spreadsheet would have been time-consuming and error-prone. Fortunately, by using **ImportXML** in Google Sheets, the task was completed efficiently and accurately.

## What is ImportXML?

According to [Google's explanation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093342?hl=en), ImportXML allows you to fetch structured data, including XML, HTML, CSV, TSV, RSS, and Atom feeds, from a webpage.

Essentially, ImportXML is a Google Sheets function that lets you scrape structured data from web pages, such as text, metadata, and more, without needing any coding knowledge.

## How Does ImportXML Help Scrape Web Elements?

The function requires just two parameters:

- **URL:** The webpage from which you want to scrape information.
- **XPath:** A language to navigate and identify elements in an XML document, used here to locate the data on the webpage.

### Example

To extract the title from the Wikipedia page on Moon landing, enter the following formula in a Google Sheets cell:

```plaintext
=IMPORTXML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "//title")
```

The result: `Moon landing â€“ Wikipedia`.

If you want to retrieve the meta description of a page, use:

```plaintext
=IMPORTXML("https://example.com/", "//meta[@name='description']/@content")
```

#### Common XPath Queries

Here are some commonly used XPath queries:

- **Page Title:** `//title`
- **Meta Description:** `//meta[@name='description']/@content`
- **H1 Tags:** `//h1`
- **Links on the Page:** `//@href`

## Google Sheet + ImportXML Case Demonstration

Google Sheets' ImportXML function is a secret weapon for many everyday tasks. When combined with other formulas, it can handle more advanced data tasks that might otherwise require Python or similar tools.

### Case: Scraping Article Data for Ads

Imagine you're tasked with creating a content ad campaign featuring the 30 latest articles in a specific category. Instead of manually collecting data from each page, you can automate the process with ImportXML.

## Step 1: Create a New Google Sheet

Begin by opening a blank Google Sheets document.

---

## Step 2: Add URLs of the Pages to Scrape

Input the URLs of the pages from which you want to scrape data. For instance, add the URL for articles under the "Pay-Per-Click" category on Search Engine Journal.

![Add URLs of the pages to scrape.](https://tomhello.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0%E8%A6%81%E6%8A%93%E5%8F%96%E7%9A%84%E9%A1%B5%E9%9D%A2%E7%9A%84-URL%E3%80%82.png)

---

## Step 3: Locate XPath

Find the elements you want to scrape, such as article titles, and copy their XPath paths.

1. Open Chrome DevTools by right-clicking an element and selecting **Inspect**.
2. Highlight the desired element in the DevTools window.
3. Right-click the highlighted HTML and choose **Copy > Copy XPath**.

## Step 4: Extract Data into Google Sheets

Back in Google Sheets, use the **ImportXML** function to extract data:

```plaintext
=IMPORTXML(B1, "//*[starts-with(@id, 'title')]")
```

### Key Notes:

1. In the example formula, the URL in cell `B1` is referenced as the first parameter.
2. Modify XPath to ensure it works for dynamic elements. For instance, replace double quotes with single quotes to avoid syntax errors in formulas.

#### Example Output:

Titles from the webpage are populated in the spreadsheet.

### Extracting Additional Data

To extract URLs:

```plaintext
=IMPORTXML(B1, "//*[starts-with(@id, 'title')]/@href")
```

To extract summaries, authors, or other data, adjust the XPath accordingly.

## Conclusion

Whether you're extracting article data or other elements like product prices or shipping costs, **ImportXML** automates the process efficiently with minimal error. This tool is particularly useful for PPC campaigns, SEO analysis, and bulk data collection.

While ImportXML in Google Sheets is free and user-friendly, it has limitations, such as scraping quotas set by Google to prevent abuse. For more advanced needs or higher data volumes, consider tools like Python-based scraping.

Streamline your data scraping workflows and save valuable time with these simple but powerful techniques!

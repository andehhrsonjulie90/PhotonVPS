# Build Your Own Advanced Web Crawler

## Introduction

This project involves building an advanced web crawler designed to extract, analyze, and store data from various websites. The crawler will handle dynamic content, adhere to **robots.txt rules**, and manage **IP rotation** to avoid detection. It will be a powerful tool for data gathering, research, and competitive analysis.

The goal is to create a **scalable API** that allows users to configure crawling jobs, manage data extraction settings, and retrieve processed data. This API will be compatible with both web and mobile interfaces, ensuring seamless data collection.

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, **web scraping** has become essential for businesses and researchers seeking insights from online sources. This project will enable effortless web data collection and analysis while ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards.

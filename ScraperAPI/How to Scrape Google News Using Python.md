## How to Scrape Google News Using Python

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll create a Python script to scrape the first 100 Google News results, including titles, descriptions, links, sources, and publication dates.

### Requirements

To scrape Google News, youâ€™ll need the following Python libraries installed:

1. **[Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)**: A library used for parsing raw HTML data.
2. **[Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)**: A library for making HTTP requests.

You can install these libraries by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

### Setting Up the Scraper

Start by importing the necessary libraries into your Python project and creating a function to fetch Google News data.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def getNewsData():
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/101.0.4951.54 Safari/537.36"
    }
    response = requests.get(
        "https://www.google.com/search?q=amazon&gl=us&tbm=nws&num=100", headers=headers
    )
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    news_results = []
```

### How It Works

1. **Set User-Agent**: The `User-Agent` header helps simulate organic browser requests to avoid detection by Google.
2. **Send HTTP Request**: Use the `requests` library to make an HTTP GET request to the target URL.
3. **Parse HTML**: Use `BeautifulSoup` to extract and parse the returned HTML response.

Next, inspect the HTML structure of the news results to identify relevant tags. For instance:
- News articles are contained within `<div class="SoaBEf">`.
- Title tags: `<div class="mCBkyc">`
- Description tags: `<div class="GI74Re">`
- Source tags: `.NUnG9d span`
- Date tags: `ZE0LJd span`

Hereâ€™s an example of a parsed result:

```json
[
  {
    "link": "https://people.com/home/housewarming-gifts-amazon-march-2023/",
    "title": "15 Beautiful Housewarming Gifts Under $100 at Amazon",
    "snippet": "Peak moving season has arrived, and you may have a few housewarmings on the horizon.",
    "date": "6 hours ago",
    "source": "People"
  },
  {
    "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/zombie-pack-mask-amazon-deal-154108906.html",
    "title": "The popular Zombie Mask is down to $17 at Amazon, today only",
    "snippet": "Daydreaming about having tighter skin? Check out this deal!",
    "date": "2 hours ago",
    "source": "Yahoo"
  }
]
```

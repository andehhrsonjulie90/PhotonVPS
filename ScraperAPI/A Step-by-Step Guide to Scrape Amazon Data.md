## How to Scrape Amazon Data for Free

### Step 1: Sign Up for Crawlbase  
Register for a Crawlbase account and get your private API token. This token will allow you to access the Crawlbase Crawling API.

### Step 2: Choose an Amazon Product Page  
Identify the product page you want to scrape. For example, a product like **PHILIPS A4216 Wireless Sports Headphones** can be an ideal choice for testing.

### Step 3: Install Node.js and the Crawlbase Library  
Ensure Node.js is installed on your system, and then install the Crawlbase Node.js library using the following command:

```bash
npm i crawlbase
```

### Step 4: Create a Scraper File  
Use the following command to create a new file for your scraper:

```bash
touch amazon-product-page-scraper.js
```

### Step 5: Configure the Crawling API  
Set up the API with the required parameters and endpoints. Add this script to your scraper file:

```javascript
const { CrawlingAPI } = require('crawlbase');
const api = new CrawlingAPI({ token: 'YOUR_CRAWLBASE_TOKEN' });

api.get('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099MPWPRY', {})
  .then(response => console.log(response.body))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

Run the script using the command:

```bash
node amazon-product-page-scraper.js
```

The API will fetch the raw HTML of the product page.

## Extracting Specific Data with JSON Formatting

Crawlbaseâ€™s Crawling API includes built-in Amazon scrapers that simplify data extraction by returning JSON-formatted results. Add the "scraper" parameter to your API request for more structured data:

```javascript
const options = { scraper: 'amazon-product' };

api.get('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099MPWPRY', options)
  .then(response => console.log(JSON.parse(response.body)))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Example JSON Response
The response will include organized product data such as:

- **Name**: The productâ€™s title.
- **Price**: The current price of the item.
- **Rating**: Customer reviews and ratings.
- **Image**: URL to the product image.

## Scraping Customer Reviews

Crawlbase also supports scraping Amazon reviews. Use the "amazon-product-reviews" scraper parameter to extract customer feedback from a product page:

```javascript
const options = { scraper: 'amazon-product-reviews' };

api.get('https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B099MPWPRY', options)
  .then(response => console.log(JSON.parse(response.body)))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

This retrieves structured review data, including reviewer names, ratings, and review text.

# Walmart Review and Feedback Guide: How to Obtain Reviews for New Listings

## Introduction

Product reviews are an integral part of driving sales. Most buyers check product reviews before deciding whether to make a purchase. This is especially true on platforms like Walmart. After making a purchase, Walmart buyers receive an email within 14 days, requesting them to leave a product review and provide feedback for the seller. If the buyer doesn't respond to the first email, Walmart sends a follow-up email 7 days later.

## Understanding Walmart Reviews

For sellers familiar with Amazon, you know that product reviews are evaluations of the product itself, not logistics, after-sales service, or delivery. Walmartâ€™s reviews work similarly but with some differences worth noting.

### Types of Walmart Reviews

1. **Incentivized Reviews**
   - These are reviews left by buyers in exchange for incentives, such as free products, discounts, or monetary rewards.

2. **Syndicated Reviews**
   - These reviews are initially published on other platforms, such as a brand's official website or Amazon. Through syndication agreements, sellers can share these reviews on Walmart.

3. **Verified Purchase Reviews**
   - These reviews come from buyers who have purchased the product and are marked with a "Verified Purchase" badge. These reviews typically carry more weight.

4. **Walmart Associate Reviews**

## Walmart Feedback Explained

Unlike product reviews, **Walmart Feedback** is related to the storeâ€™s logistics, service, and after-sales experienceâ€”not the product itself. Any buyer who purchases from a seller can leave feedback, which impacts the sellerâ€™s performance metrics.

### Key Features of Walmart Feedback

- Feedback ratings range from 1 to 5 stars.
- Feedback is displayed on the storeâ€™s homepage.
- Each order can generate one feedback entry, which will appear on the seller's profile within 5-7 business days.

### Feedback Approval Conditions

To pass Walmartâ€™s review process, feedback must:

- Avoid obscene or defamatory language.
- Be relevant to the seller and not include unrelated comments.
- Exclude personal information like emails, phone numbers, or physical addresses.
- Avoid malicious content or spam.
- Reference only verified purchases.

### When Can Sellers Request Feedback Removal?

Sellers can request Walmart to delete feedback in cases such as:

- Mismatched ratings and comments.
- Obscene or defamatory language in feedback.
- Comments unrelated to the sellerâ€™s service (e.g., product-specific complaints).

## Managing Negative Reviews

Negative reviews are inevitable, but sellers can take steps to minimize their impact:

1. **Identify and Fix Root Causes**: Address product quality issues to prevent recurring negative reviews.
2. **Removal Requests**: Negative reviews that meet Walmartâ€™s criteria for removal can be addressed through the official process.
3. **Avoid Manipulative Practices**: Sellers should not attempt to induce buyers to leave reviews through prohibited methods, as this risks account penalties.
